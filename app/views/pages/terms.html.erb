<h3>Dr. Roebuck’s Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>The privacy of individuals connected with our business, including our customers, contractors, employees, independent operators and website visitors, has always been of great importance to Dr. Roebuck’s. Keeping personal information in strict confidence is a cornerstone of our business. Regardless of how the range of products we offer our customers expands, and the technology we use changes, we will always strive to protect the privacy of personal information, subject to any consent an individual has provided for its use. </p>
<p>This policy describes the principles on which Dr. Roebuck’s and its subsidiaries and divisions will protect the privacy of personal information. The policy is based on the Canadian Standards Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information. While this document sets out the principles on which Dr. Roebuck’s privacy practices are based, privacy laws will vary from province to province and those laws may also govern Dr. Roebuck’s privacy practices in such province. This policy is part of Dr. Roebuck’s commitment to ensure that all personal information of individuals in its possession is protected and used in accordance with the law. Privacy laws across Canada are evolving, and therefore this policy is subject to change. </p>
<p>Personal Information is any information about an identifiable person, other than the name, title, business address and business telephone number of a person. It includes such things as a person’s home address, date of birth, social insurance number, and medical and financial information. With respect to customers, such information is collected primarily in connection with products provided by Dr. Roebuck’s. Employees may be asked to provide such information to Dr. Roebuck’s in connection with matters relating to their employment. In all cases, Dr. Roebuck’s is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals and the integrity of their personal information.</p> 
<h3>1. Accountability</h3>
<p>Dr. Roebuck’s is responsible for personal information under its control, including any personal information disclosed to third parties for handling or administrative purposes. 
With respect to personal information that has been transferred to a third party for processing, Dr. Roebuck’s will use contractual or other means, and may include the examination of such third party’s practices with respect to personal information, to safeguard personal information while it is being processed by a third party.  </p>

<p><strong>3.2</strong> Dr. Roebuck’s is committed to obtaining meaningful consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information.

<p><strong>3.5</strong> Consent may be express or implied, given orally, electronically or in writing and provided by an action or inaction. Consent may be given through a legally appointed representative or a legal guardian.</p>
